# INF112 Maven template 
Simple skeleton with libgdx. 

To use this program:
when opening the window, enter in the console window if you want to play multiplayer or singleplayer, and if you want to host or not.

click on cards to program your robot and click the "P" keyboard button to execute the commands.
lower left robot is player 1 and upper right is player 2
Host is always player 1.


## Known bugs

resizing the window doesn't change the card boxes, so where you can hover over the cards doesn't line up with the card images anymore
