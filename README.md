### INF112 Maven template 
Simple skeleton with libgdx. 

**To use this program:**

* Ensure maven install and build is complete. Run Main. A menu screen will render. You’ll have a choice to play offline or online. 
Keep in mind if you choose to play online with someone else, the host must have port forward set up. The clients must enter the host’ IP and port number.

* Your robot will have green text above it and the host is always player 1.
When in game, click the cards in the sequence you want them to be play (you can also unclick cards if you change your mind). Then the PLAY button or "p" on your keyboard to execute your moves.

### Known bugs

Resizing the window doesn't change the card boxes, so where you can hover over the cards doesn't line up with the card images anymore
